# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is going to be an on-going learning experience to build a peer to peer chat application.

This app is designed to have a conversation between one another but allow the user to see a translated message from Google Translate API

The sender will send it (most likely in English for now), and the receiver will have the option of receiving the input in their language of choice (whatever Google can offer/translate successfully).

The receiver will have a "tolerance" bar to set the level of translated messages (beginner, intermediate, advanced, fluent). My hopes is that when the messages goes through to the receiver, the function will randomly select (at first) words in the sent message and translate them based on the tolernace set, hence, Broken English.
